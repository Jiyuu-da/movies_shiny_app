# Data Exploration and Visualization with Polars and Shiny

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Polars for data cleaning and exploration, and then create an interactive web application using Shiny to visualize the data. The workflow includes data preprocessing with Polars, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a Shiny app to present the findings in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

### Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration:**
  - Uses Polars for efficient data cleaning and transformation.
  - Performs exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns.

- **Shiny Application:**
  - Develops an interactive web app with Shiny to visualize and interact with the data.
  - Provides users with an intuitive interface to explore the data through various visualizations.

### Data Cleaning and Exploration

#### Tools

- **Polars:** A fast DataFrame library for Rust and Python, used for data manipulation and analysis.

#### Key Steps

- **Loading Data:** Import the dataset into Polars.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
- **Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis to summarize the data and identify key trends and patterns.


### Shiny Application

#### Tools

- **Shiny:** A Python and R package for building interactive web applications.

#### Features

- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to explore the dataset.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to filter and customize views to analyze different aspects of the data.
